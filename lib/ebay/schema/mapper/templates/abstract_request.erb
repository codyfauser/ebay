# eBay specifies the detail level as a collection.  The usual case is to use
# only a single detail level, so it is more appropriate to add an accessor for 
# the normal case.
# Reads the first detail level from the detail_levels Array.
def detail_level
  @detail_levels.first
end

# Overwrites the details_levels Array with a new Array containing only the 
# value passed in as an argument
